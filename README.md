# Project_IW2.0 - Assistive Control Devices & Classification of Motor Imagery Tasks from EEG Signals using a LSTM Network

Paper: publication date on hold, please contact me for more information.

Tasks: 
- Classification of 4 Motor Imagery Tasks (directions: front, right, left, Stop) based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks through EEG signals collected by BCI Neurosky Mindwave Mobile 2. 
- Development of an graphical interface of a mobile differential robot controlled by the TAP Strap 2 tracking sensor.
